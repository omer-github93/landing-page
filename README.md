## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

Stuffs that i've worked on in this project:
---------------------------------------------
# section menu created dynamically by javascript DOM according to section in HTML
# active class is added whenever the menu item is clicked
# jump to section when menu item is clicked by adding a powerful css property to whole html page (scroll-behavior: smooth;) to make scrolling effect smoother
# back to top button when scrolling down the button appears
# Mobile Navigation Menu sidebar
